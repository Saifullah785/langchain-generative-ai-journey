      "Here are 5 interesting facts about the Python programming language:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Python was named after a British comedy group**\n",
      "The Python programming language was named after the British comedy group Monty Python's Flying Circus, which was known for its surreal and often absurd sense of humor. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, was a fan of the group and chose the name as a nod to their creative and unconventional approach to comedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Python was created in just 12 weeks**\n",
      "Guido van Rossum started working on Python in December 1989 and released the first version, Python 0.9.1, in February 1991. He spent only 12 weeks developing the language, which is incredibly fast considering the complexity of the task. Van Rossum has said that he wanted to create a language that was easy to learn and use, and he achieved this goal with remarkable speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Python is a dynamically-typed language**\n",
      "Unlike languages like Java and C++, which are statically-typed, Python is dynamically-typed. This means that Python doesn't check the data type of a variable until runtime, which makes it easier to write code and reduces the need for explicit type conversions. This flexibility is one of the reasons why Python is so popular among beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Python is used by many popular websites and applications**\n",
      "Python is used by many well-known companies and organizations, including Google, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, and Reddit. It's also used in many scientific and research applications, such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Python's popularity is due in part to its ease of use, flexibility, and extensive libraries and frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Python has a unique syntax**\n",
      "Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability. It uses indentation to denote block-level structure, which makes it easy to write and read code. Python also uses a syntax that's similar to natural language, with concise and expressive statements that make it easy to write code that's easy to understand. For example, Python's `print()` function is used to print output to the screen, and it can be used with a simple statement like `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n",

    "Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.\n",
    "\n",

    "Some advantages of decision trees are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Some tree and algorithm combinations support missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, the scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for now. Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",

    "Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but piecewise constant approximations as seen in the above figure. Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",

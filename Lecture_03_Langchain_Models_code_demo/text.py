## open source models for text generation


# mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3: A popular and powerful 7 billion parameter model known for its instruction-following capabilities.

# Llama 2 7B/13B: Meta's Llama 2 models are available in various sizes and are widely used for research and applications.

# OpenLLaMA: A permissively licensed open-source language model.

# GPT-2 (various sizes): While older, GPT-2 models are still useful for experimentation and learning. They are available in different sizes, making them accessible for various hardware configurations.


## open source models for text embeddings

## Sentence Transformers models: 
# 
# These are specifically designed for generating sentence embeddings. all-mpnet-base-v2 is a good starting point, but explore others like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for faster inference with slightly lower quality.

# E5 models: 
# 
# The E5 (Embeddings from Everywhere) models are trained on a large and diverse dataset, making them robust for various tasks. intfloat/e5-large-v2 is a popular choice.

# BGE models: 
# 
# The BGE (BAAI General Embedding) models are another strong contender, known for their performance on retrieval tasks. BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 is a good option.

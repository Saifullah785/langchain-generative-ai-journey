# LangChain Generative AI Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal learning repository on **Generative AI using LangChain**. This space is dedicated to documenting my hands-on learning experience, broken down by topic, with code snippets, explanations, and mini-projects.

## 📚 Goals
- Learn LangChain from beginner to advanced level
- Understand how to build generative AI applications
- Create well-documented examples and summaries for revision
- Track learning progress and share knowledge with others

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- [ ] Introduction to LangChain
- [ ] LangChain Components (LLMs, Chains, Agents)
- [ ] Prompt Engineering
- [ ] Memory Management
- [ ] Tool Integration (e.g., search, calculator)
- [ ] Vector Stores & Embeddings
- [ ] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- [ ] LangChain with OpenAI / Hugging Face
- [ ] LangChain and Streamlit Projects
- [ ] Production-Ready Applications

## 📂 Structure
Each topic will have:
- ✅ A folder with code and notes
- 📄 `README.md` with concept explanation
- 🧪 Mini-projects or use-case implementations

## 📆 Learning Logs
I will update logs weekly to track what I've learned and any challenges encountered.

## 🔗 Resources
Curated resources, articles, and official docs used during the learning process.
